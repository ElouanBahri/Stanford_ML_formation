# â˜‘ Stanford_ML_formation 
This project uses **Python == 3.11**.


## 1. Description  

This repo is inspired by the **Machine Learning Specialization** led by **Andrew Ng** through **DeepLearning.AI** on Coursera. The specialization consists of three core courses:  
1. **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**  
2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**  
3. **Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, and Reinforcement Learning**  

Throughout the program, I gained a comprehensive understanding of key machine learning concepts, including:  
- **Supervised Learning:** Linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees.  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.  
- **Recommender Systems and Reinforcement Learning.**  

The project reflects my practical application of these skills, focusing on implementing machine learning models in Python and applying them to real-world problems. By following this specialization, I acquired best practices for building robust models and handling large datasets, paving the way for deeper exploration into AI and data science.
